2016-10-9: version 1.1
Added curve library as an example of how to use dual numbers for
automatic differentiation.
API changes:
In Matrix2x2.hpp, renamed 'tmul' and 'mult' to resp. 'transposeMul' and
'mulTranspose' to match Matrix3x3.hpp


2016-3-7: version 1.0
Added jointlimits example code accompanying Chapter 10 "Rotational Joint Limits
in Quaternion Space" of "Game Engine Gems 3".
API changes:
In DualVector3.hpp, renamed 'linvel' to 'moment'
In Matrix3x3.hpp, renamed 'cross' to 'skew' 

2014-3-14: version 0.2.4
Added wrappers for atomic intrinsics in order to remove the dependency on TBB.
Added a thread-safe lock-free singleton base class.
STATIC_ASSERT now can be used outside class templates.
Changed "axisAngle" to "fromAxisAngle".

2013-10-4: version 0.2.3
Fixed guts::RefPtr reference count for copy constructor 
Fixed guts::Vector for Visual C++ 11.0
Added isfinite predicate for vector types
Added logUnit and exp for unit dual quaternions
Matrix4x4 is now row-major. All matrix types are now row major. 
Added Matrix3x4 for affine transformations.
		   
2013-03-23: version 0.2.2
Imported the motion toolkit into a Google code repository.

2012-03-20: version 0.2.1
Added an example on how to use dual numbers for computing second-order derivatives,
as a follow up on a question asked at my GDC 2012 dual numbers talk.

2012-03-06:	version 0.2
GDC 2012 release accompanying my talk "Math for Game Programmmers Tutorial: Dual Numbers"
