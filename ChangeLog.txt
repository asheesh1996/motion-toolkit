!!Matrix3x3 constructor from three vectors now takes rows instead of columns,
in order to conform to the other matrix types. Sorry for the confusion.
Matrix3x3::setValue taking three vectors has been replaced by setColumns and
setRows. I'm terrible, I know.

In Vector3.hpp, added 'normal' and modified 'triple' for respectively
computing the normal to a triangle and the triple product of three vectors,
such that the relative rounding error in the result is minimized.

Updated ErrorTracer.hpp in accordance with my GDC 2019 presentation.

Moved unit tests to a separate test directory.

2017-10-13: 
Added Matrix3x3 'orthonormalize'.
Added 'xy' function to cast a Vector3 to a Vector2.
Fixed Matrix4x4 'transpose' (non-sse).
Removed Vector4 'norm' function as it was already provided by 'lengthSquared' in Metric.hpp.
The 'abs' function on Vector4 now returns the component-wise absolute of Vector4 rather than magnitude.
(Previously 'abs' was provided for quaternions as a generalization of 'abs' for complex numbers, but this was confusing
since 'abs' on Vector3 returned the component-wise absolute. Now both overloads have the same semantic. The magnitude
of a quaternion can be returned using 'length' in Metric.hpp.)
Updated Google test to the latest version.

2016-10-9: version 1.1
Added curve library as an example of how to use dual numbers for
automatic differentiation.
API changes:
In Matrix2x2.hpp, renamed 'tmul' and 'mult' to resp. 'transposeMul' and
'mulTranspose' to match Matrix3x3.hpp


2016-3-7: version 1.0
Added jointlimits example code accompanying Chapter 10 "Rotational Joint Limits
in Quaternion Space" of "Game Engine Gems 3".
API changes:
In DualVector3.hpp, renamed 'linvel' to 'moment'
In Matrix3x3.hpp, renamed 'cross' to 'skew' 

2014-3-14: version 0.2.4
Added wrappers for atomic intrinsics in order to remove the dependency on TBB.
Added a thread-safe lock-free singleton base class.
STATIC_ASSERT now can be used outside class templates.
Changed "axisAngle" to "fromAxisAngle".

2013-10-4: version 0.2.3
Fixed guts::RefPtr reference count for copy constructor 
Fixed guts::Vector for Visual C++ 11.0
Added isfinite predicate for vector types
Added logUnit and exp for unit dual quaternions
Matrix4x4 is now row-major. All matrix types are now row major. 
Added Matrix3x4 for affine transformations.
		   
2013-03-23: version 0.2.2
Imported the motion toolkit into a Google code repository.

2012-03-20: version 0.2.1
Added an example on how to use dual numbers for computing second-order derivatives,
as a follow up on a question asked at my GDC 2012 dual numbers talk.

2012-03-06:	version 0.2
GDC 2012 release accompanying my talk "Math for Game Programmmers Tutorial: Dual Numbers"
